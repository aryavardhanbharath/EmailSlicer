An email slicer is a small utility that takes an email address and splits it into two parts:
- **Username** – everything before the `@` symbol
- **Domain** – everything after the `@` symbol

For example:
Input: john.doe@example.com
Output: Your user name is 'john.doe' and your domain is 'example.com'
